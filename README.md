# BetterRadar

## Description

This project is a continuation of the Epitech "my_radar" project. Its main goal is to push optimization to the absolute limit. While the original base project struggles to manage a massive number of entities, this improved version is fully capable of handling and rendering **100,000 ships at 60 FPS**.

## How to run

The project was written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) 0.15.2

To run the project with maximum optimizations (critical for high performance):

```bash
zig build release
```

The generated executable will be located in `zig-out/bin/betterradar`.

## Optimizations implemented

To reach the 100k entities at 60 FPS milestone, several major optimizations were introduced:

- **SIMD Instructions:** Intensive calculations, such as updating ship positions and checking distances, are vectorized using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data). This allows the CPU to process multiple entities in a single clock cycle, significantly maximizing throughput and reducing overall computation time.
- **Uniform Grid:** Collision detection is no longer done naively by testing every ship against every other ship (which would result in an $O(n^2)$ complexity). By using a spatial grid structure (`uniform_grid.zig`), space is partitioned into cells. Thus, to detect a collision, a ship is only compared against entities in its own cell or adjacent ones, drastically reducing the required calculations.
- **Avoiding dynamic allocations:** Optimization relies on smart allocation and the use of tailored data structures, minimizing bottlenecks caused by runtime memory management.
- **Data-Oriented Design (DOD):** The architecture is centered around DOD principles to drastically reduce CPU cache misses. By arranging data in contiguous blocks in memory (often favoring Struct of Arrays over Array of Structs), the CPU cache lines are filled with relevant data for each instruction pass. This prevents processor stalls caused by slow fetching from the main RAM, making sure that iterating over 100,000 entities remains blazing fast.
